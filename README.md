<h3 id="maxwell-header" style="margin-top: -10px; font-weight: bold">Maxwell = Mysql + Kafka</h3>


This is Maxwell's daemon, an application that reads MySQL binlogs and writes row updates to Kafka as JSON.
It's playing in the same space as [mypipe](https://github.com/mardambey/mypipe) and [databus](http://data.linkedin.com/projects/databus),
but differentiates itself with these features:

- Works with an unpatched mysql
- Parses ALTER/CREATE/DROP table statements, which allows Maxwell to always have a correct view of the mysql schema
- Stores its replication position and needed data within the mysql server itself
- Requires no external dependencies (save Kafka, if used)
- Eschews the complexity of Avro for plain old JSON.
- Minimal setup

Maxwell is intended as a source for event-based readers, eg various ETL applications, search indexing,
stat emitters.
