When running Maxwell with --bootstrapper=sync , the same thread is used to do bootstrapping, meaning that all binlog events are blocked until bootstrapping is complete. Running Maxwell with --bootstrapper=async however, will make Maxwell spawn a separate thread for bootstrapping. In this async mode, non-bootstrapped tables are replicated as normal by the main thread, while the binlog events for bootstrapped tables are queued and sent to the replication stream at the end of the bootstrap process. Bootstrapping Data Format a bootstrap starts with an event of type = \"bootstrap-start\" then events with type = \"bootstrap-insert\" (one per row in the table) then one event per INSERT , UPDATE or DELETE with standard event types i.e. type = \"insert\" , type = \"update\" or type = \"delete\" that occurred since the beginning of bootstrap finally an event with type = \"bootstrap-complete\" Here's a complete example: mysql> create table fooDB.barTable(txt varchar(255)); mysql> insert into fooDB.barTable (txt) values (\"hello\"), (\"bootstrap!\"); mysql> insert into maxwell.bootstrap (database_name, table_name) values (\"fooDB\", \"barTable\"); Corresponding replication stream output of table fooDB.barTable : {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"insert\",\"ts\":1450557598,\"xid\":13,\"data\":{\"txt\":\"hello\"}} {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"insert\",\"ts\":1450557598,\"xid\":13,\"data\":{\"txt\":\"bootstrap!\"}} {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"bootstrap-start\",\"ts\":1450557744,\"data\":{}} {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"bootstrap-insert\",\"ts\":1450557744,\"data\":{\"txt\":\"hello\"}} {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"bootstrap-insert\",\"ts\":1450557744,\"data\":{\"txt\":\"bootstrap!\"}} {\"database\":\"fooDB\",\"table\":\"barTable\",\"type\":\"bootstrap-complete\",\"ts\":1450557744,\"data\":{}} Failure Scenarios If Maxwell crashes during bootstrapping the next time it runs it will rerun the bootstrap in its entirety - regardless of previous progress.

Released 2018-06-15 v1.15.0 This is a bug-fix release, but it's big enough I'm giving it a minor version.

Fix the fact that maxwell was outputting \"next-position\" instead of \"position\" of a row into JSON. Fix the master-recovery code to store schema that corresponds to the start of a row, and points the replicator at the next-position. Much thanks to Tim, Likun and others in sorting this mess out.

Add missing Kafka clients Listen and report on binlog connector lifecycle events for better visibility Reduce docker image size Released 2017-10-30 v1.10.8 Fix docker builds Add Google Cloud Pub/Sub producer RabbitMQ producer enhancements Released 2017-10-12 v1.10.7 Java 8 upgrade Diagnostic health check endpoint Encryption Documentation update: encryption, kinesis producer, schema storage fundamentals, etc. Released 2017-10-11 v1.10.6 Binlog-connector upgrade Bug-fix: when using literal string for an option that accepts Regex, Regex characters are no longer special If master recovery is enabled, Maxwell cleans up old positions for the same server and client id Released 2017-08-14 v1.10.5 Shyko's binlog-connector is now the default and only replication backend available for maxwell. Released 2017-07-25 v1.10.4 Notable changes: Shutdown hardening. If maxwell can't shut down (because the kafka producer is in a bad state and close() never terminates, for example), it would previously stall and process no messages. Now, shutdown is run in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10 seconds. Initial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own process. This mode of operation is still experimental, but we'll accept PRs to improve it (thanks Geoff Lywood). Fix incorrect handling of negative (pre-epoch dates) when using binlog_connector mode (thanks Geoff Lywood). Released 2017-07-10 v1.10.3 tiny release to fix a units error in the replication.lag metric (subtracting seconds from milliseconds) Released 2017-06-06 v1.10.2 added metrics: \"replication.queue.time\" and \"inflightmessages.count\" renamed \"time.overall\" metric to \"message.publish.time\" documentation updates (thanks Chintan Tank) Released 2017-06-04 v1.10.1 The observable changes in this minor release are a new configuration for Kafka/Kinesis producer to abort processing on publish errors, and support of Kafka 0.10.2. Also a bunch of good refactoring has been done for heartbeat processing. List of changes: Support Kafka 0.10.2 Stop procesing RDS hearbeats Keep maxwell heartbeat going every 10 seconds when database is quiet Allow for empty double-quoted string literals for database schema changes Ignore Kafka/Kinesis producer errors based on new configuration ignore_producer_error Released 2017-05-26 v1.10.0 This is a small release, primarily around a change to how schemas are stored. Maxwell now stores the last_heartbeat_read with each entry in the schemas table, making schema management more resilient to cases where binlog numbers are reused, but means that you must take care if you need to roll back to an earlier version. If you deploy v1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually update all schemas . last_heartbeat_read values to 0 before redeploying v1.10.0 or higher. Other minor changes: allow negative default numbers in columns only store final binlog position if it has changed blacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*' log4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging) Released 2017-05-09 v1.9.0 Maxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by Scott Ferguson. Multiple backends can be configured, read the updated docs for full details. There's also some bugfixes: filter DDL messages based on config determine newest schema from binlog order, not creation order add task manager to shutdown cleanly on error minor logging improvements Released 2017-04-26 v1.8.2 Bugfix release. maxwell would crash on a quoted partition name fixes for alters on non-string tables containing VARCHAR use seconds instead of milliseconds for DDL messages Released 2017-04-11 v1.8.1 performance improves in capturing and restoring schema, thx Joren Minnaert Allow for capturing from a separate mysql host (adds support for using Maxscale as a replication proxy), thx Adam Szkoda Released 2017-02-20 v1.8.0 In version 1.8.0 Maxwell gains alpha support for GTID-based positions! All praise due to Henry Cai. Released 2017-02-14 v1.7.2 Fix a bug found where maxwell could cache the wrong TABLE_MAP_ID for a binlog event, leading to crashes or in some cases data mismatches. Released 2017-01-30 v1.7.1 bootstrapping now can take a --where clause performance improvements in the kafka producer Released 2017-01-24 v1.7.0 Maxwell 1.7 brings 2 major new, alpha features. The first is Mysql 5.7 support, including JSON column type support and handling of 5.7 SQL, but not including GTID support yet. This is based on porting Maxwell to Stanley Shyko's binlog-connector library. Thanks to Stanley for his amazing support doing this port. The second major new feature is a producer for Amazon's Kinesis streams, This was contributed in full by the dogged and persistent Thomas Dziedzic. Check it out with --producer=kinesis . There's also some bugfixes: - Amazon RDS heartbeat events now tick maxwell's position, thx Scott Ferguson - allow CHECK() statements inside column definitions Released 2017-01-07 v1.6.0 This is mostly a bugfix release, but it gets a minor version bump due to a single change of behavior: dates and timestamps which mysql may accept, but are considered invalid (0000-00-00 is a notable example) previously had inconsistent behavior. Now we convert these to NULL. Other bugfixes: - heartbeats have moved into their own table - more fixes around alibaba rds - ignore DELETE statements that are output for MEMORY tables upon server restart - allow pointing maxwell to a pre-existing database Released 2016-12-29 v1.5.2 add support for kafka 0.10.1 @ smferguson master recovery: cleanup positions from previous master; prevent errors on flip-back. fix a bug that would trigger in certain cases when dropping a column that was part of the primary-key Released 2016-12-07 v1.5.1 This is a bugfix release. - fixes for bootstrapping with an alternative maxwell-schema name and an include_database filter, thanks Lucian Jones - fixes for kafka 0.10 with lz4 compression, thanks Scott Ferguson - ignore the RDS table mysql.ha_health_check table - Get the bootstrapping process to output NULL values. - fix a quoting issue in the bootstrap code, thanks @mylesjao. Released 2016-11-24 v1.5.0 CHANGE: Kafka producer no longer ships with hard-coded defaults. Please ensure you have \"compression.type\", \"metadata.fetch.timeout.ms\", and \"retries\" configured to your liking. bugfix: fix a regression in handling ALTER TABLE change c int after b statements warn on servers with missing server_id Released 2016-11-07 v1.4.2 kafka 0.10.0 support, as well as a re-working of the --kafka_version command line option. Released 2016-11-01 v1.4.1 support per-table topics, Thanks @smferguson and @sschatts. fix a parser issue with DROP COLUMN CASCADE, thanks @smferguson Released 2016-10-27 v1.4.0 1.4.0 brings us two nice new features: - partition-by-column: see --kafka_partition_columns. Thanks @smferguson - output schema changes as JSON: see --output_ddl. Thanks @xmlking - As well as a fix around race conditions on shutdown. Released 2016-10-21 v1.3.0 support for fractional DATETIME, TIME, TIMESTAMP columns, thanks @Dagnan support for outputting server_id & thread_id, thanks @sagiba fix a race condition in bootstrap support Released 2016-10-03 v1.2.2 Maxwell will now include by default fields with NULL values (as null fields). To disable this and restore the old functionality where fields were omitted, pass --output_nulls=false Fix an issue with multi-client support where two replicators would ping-pong heartbeats at each other Fix an issue where a client would attempt to recover a position from a mismatched client_id Fix a bug when using CHANGE COLUMN on a primary key Released 2016-09-23 v1.2.1 This is a bugfix release. - fix a parser bug around ALTER TABLE CHARACTER SET - fix bin/maxwell to pull in the proper version of the kafka-clients library Released 2016-09-15 v1.2.0 1.2.0 is a major release of Maxwell that introduces master recovery features; when a slave is promoted to master, Maxwell is now capable of recovering the position. See the --master_recovery flag for more details. It also upgrades the kafka producer library to 0.9. If you're using maxwell with a kafka 0.8 server, you must now pass the --kafka0.8 flag to maxwell. Released 2016-09-12 v1.1.6 minor bugfix in which maxwell with --replay mode was trying to write heartbeats Released 2016-09-07 v1.1.5 @dadah89 adds --output_binlog_position to optionally output the position with the row @dadah89 adds --output_commit_info to turn off xid/commit fields maxwell now supports tables with partitions maxwell now supports N maxwells per-server. see the client_id / replica_server_id options. two parser fixes, for engine= innodb and CHARSET ASCII lay the ground work for doing master recovery; we add a heartbeat into the positions table that we can co-ordinate around. Released 2016-09-04 v1.1.4 add support for a bunch more charsets (gbk, big5, notably) fix Maxwell's handling of kafka errors - previously we were trying to crash Maxwell by throwing a RuntimeException out of the Kafka Producer, but this was a failure.

Released 2015-10-16 v0.11.4 this is another bugfix release that fixes a problem where the replication thread can die in the middle of processing a transaction event. I really need to fix this at a lower level, ie the open-replicator level. Released 2015-09-30 v0.11.3 this is a bugfix release: - fix problems with table creation options inside alter statements ( ALTER TABLE foo auto_increment=10 ) - fix a host of shutdown-procedure bugs the test suite should also be way more reliable, not like you care. Released 2015-09-29 v0.11.2 This is a bugfix release. It includes: - soft deletions of maxwell.schemas to fix A->B->A master swapping without creating intense replication delay - detect and fail early if we see binlog_row_image=minimal - kill off maxwell if the position thread dies - fix a bug where maxwell could pick up a copy of schema from a different server_id (curse you operator precedence!) Released 2015-09-18 v0.11.1 maxwell gets a very minimal pass at detecting when a master has changed, in which it will kill off schemas and positions from a server_id that no longer is valid. this should prevent the worst of cases. Released 2015-09-16 v0.11.0 This release of Maxwell preserves transaction information in the kafka stream by adding a xid key in the JSON object, as well as a commit key for the final row inside the transaction.

Released 2015-04-13 v0.6.1 fixes a bug with parsing length-limited indexes. Released 2015-04-13 v0.6.0 Version 0.6.0 has Maxwell outputting a JSON kafka key, so that one can use Kafka's neat \"store the last copy of a key\" retention policy. It also fixes a couple of bugs in the query parsing path. Released 2015-04-09 v0.5.0 maxwell now captures primary keys on tables. We'll use this to form kafka key names later. maxwell now outputs to a single topic, hashing the data by database name to keep a database's updates in order. Released 2015-04-06 v0.4.0 v0.4.0 fixes some bugs with long-lived mysql connections by adding connection pooling support. Released 2015-03-25 v0.3.0 This version fixes a fairly nasty bug in which the binlog-position flush thread was sharing a connection with the rest of the system, leading to crashes.

The data will look like: row with no commit , xid=142 row with no commit , xid=142 row with commit=true , xid=142 row with no commit , xid=155 ... \u21b3 \"primary_key\": [1,\"2016-10-21 05:33:37.523000\"], You only get this with --output_primary_key.

Note that you will still have to re-point maxwell to the new master (or use a floating VIP) RDS To run Maxwell against RDS, (either Aurora or Mysql) you will need to do the following: set binlog_format to \"ROW\". Do this in the \"parameter groups\" section.

The tl;dr is to execute call mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 24) on the server. Replicating and storing schema from different servers Maxwell uses MySQL for 3 different functions: A host to store the captured schema in ( --host ). A host to replicate binlogs from ( --replication_host ). A host to capture the schema from ( --schema_host ). Often, all three hosts are the same. host and replication_host should be different if maxwell is chained off a replica. schema_host should only be used when using the maxscale replication proxy. Multiple Maxwells Maxwell can operate with multiple instances running against a single master, in different configurations. This can be useful if you wish to have producers running in different configurations, for example producing different groups of tables to different topics. Each instance of Maxwell must be configured with a unique client_id , in order to store unique binlog positions. Each version of Maxwell must also be configured with a unique replica_server_id . This is a 32-bit integer that corresponds to mysql's server_id parameter. The value should be unique across all maxwell instances and also be unique from any mysql server_id values. --init_position This is a dangerous option that you really shouldn't use unless you know what you're doing. It allows you to \"rewind\" history and go back to a certain point in the binlog. This can work, but you should be aware that Maxwell must have already \"visited\" that binlog position; simply specifying an arbitrary position in the binlog will lead to Maxwell crashing. Running with limited permissions If the user you're running maxwell as can't view part of the database because of limited permissions, Maxwell may be unable to capture information on part of the schem a and the replication stream can break with \"Can't find table: XXX\" errors.

Example 2 Filter options are evaluated in the order specified, so in this example we suppress everything except updates in the db1 database. --filter = 'exclude: *.*, include: db1.*' Column Filters Maxwell can also include/exclude based on column values: --filter = 'exclude: db.tbl.col = reject' will reject any row in db.tbl that contains col and where the stringified value of \"col\" is \"reject\". Column filters are ignored if the specified column is not present, so --filter = 'exclude: *.*.col_a = *' will exclude updates to any table that contains col_a , but include every other table. Blacklisting In rare cases, you may wish to tell Maxwell to completely ignore a database or table, including schema changes. In general, don't use this.

It is configurable via --kafka_topic . The given topic can be a plain string or a dynamic string, e.g. namespace_%{database}_%{table} , where the topic will be generated from data in the row. Client version By default, maxwell uses the kafka 1.0.0 library. The --kafka_version flag lets you choose an alternate library version: 0.8.2.2, 0.9.0.1, 0.10.0.1, 0.10.2.1 or 0.11.0.1, 1.0.0. This flag is only available on the command line. The 0.8.2.2 client is only compatible with brokers running kafka 0.8. The 0.10.0.x client is only compatible with brokers 0.10.0.x or later. Mixing the 0.10 client with other versions can lead to serious performance impacts. For More details, read about it here . The 0.11.0 client can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. The 0.9.0.1 client is not compatible with brokers running kafka 0.8. The exception below will show in logs when that is the case: ERROR Sender - Uncaught error in kafka producer I/O thread: SchemaException: Error reading field 'throttle_time_ms': java.nio.BufferUnderflowException Passing options to kafka Any options present in config.properties that are prefixed with kafka. will be passed into the Kafka producer library (with kafka. stripped off, see below for examples). We use the \"new producer\" configuration, as described here: http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs Example kafka configs Highest throughput These properties would give high throughput performance. kafka.acks = 1 kafka.compression.type = snappy kafka.retries=0 Most reliable For at-least-once delivery, you will want something more like: kafka.acks = all kafka.retries = 5 # or some larger number And you will also want to set min.insync.replicas on Maxwell's output topic. Key format Maxwell generates keys for its Kafka messages based upon a mysql row's primary key in JSON format: { \"database\":\"test_tb\",\"table\":\"test_tbl\",\"pk.id\":4,\"pk.part2\":\"hello\"} This key is designed to co-operate with Kafka's log compaction, which will save the last-known value for a key, allowing Maxwell's Kafka stream to retain the last-known value for a row and act as a source of truth. Partitioning Kafka, AWS Kinesis/SNS/SQS support the notion of partitioned streams. Because they like to make our lives hard, Kafka calls its two units \"topics\" and \"partitions\", Kinesis calls them \"streams\" and \"shards\", and SNS/SQS calls them \"group id\". They're the same thing, though. Maxwell is generally configured to write to N partitions/shards on one topic/stream, and how it distributes to those N partitions/shards can be controlled by producer_partition_by . producer_partition_by gives you a choice of splitting your stream by database, table, primary key, transaction id, column data, or \"random\". How you choose to partition your stream greatly influences the load and serialization properties of your downstream consumers, so choose carefully. A good rule of thumb is to use the finest-grained partition scheme possible given serialization constraints. A brief partitioning digression: If I were building, say, a simple search index of a single table, I might choose to partition by primary key; this would give you the best distribution of workload amongst your stream processors while maintaining a strict ordering of updates that happen to a certain row. If I were building something that needed better serialization properties -- let's say I needed to maintain strict ordering between updates that occured on different tables -- I would drop back to partitioning by table or database. This will reduce my throughput by a lot as a single stream consumer node will end up will all the load for particular table/database, but I'm guaranteed that the updates stay in order. If you choose to partition by column data (that is, values inside columns in your updates), you must set both: producer_partition_columns - a comma-separated list of column names, and producer_partiton_by_fallback - [ database , table , primary_key ] - this will be used as the partition key when the column does not exist. When partitioning by column Maxwell will treat the values for the specified columns as strings, concatenate them and use that value to partition the data. Kafka partitioning A binlog event's partition is determined by the selected hash function and hash string as follows HASH_FUNCTION(producer_partion_value) % TOPIC.NUMBER_OF_PARTITIONS The HASH_FUNCTION is either java's hashCode or murmurhash3 . The default HASH_FUNCTION is hashCode . Murmurhash3 may be set with the kafka_partition_hash option. The seed value for the murmurhash function is hardcoded to 25342 in the MaxwellKafkaPartitioner class. We tell you this in case you need to reverse engineer where a row will land. Maxwell will discover the number of partitions in its kafka topic upon boot. This means that you should pre-create your kafka topics: bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper ZK_HOST:2181 --create \\ --topic maxwell --partitions 20 --replication-factor 2 http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart Kinesis AWS Credentials You will need to obtain an IAM user that has the following permissions for the stream you are planning on producing to: \"kinesis:PutRecord\" \"kinesis:PutRecords\" \"kinesis:DescribeStream\" Additionally, the producer will need to be able to produce CloudWatch metrics which requires the following permission applied to the resource `*``: - \"cloudwatch:PutMetricData\" The resulting IAM policy document may look like this: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"kinesis:PutRecord\", \"kinesis:PutRecords\", \"kinesis:DescribeStream\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:123456789012:stream/my-stream\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"cloudwatch:PutMetricData\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } See the AWS docs for the latest examples on which permissions are needed. The producer uses the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain class to gain aws credentials. See the AWS docs on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain. Options Set the output stream in config.properties by setting the kinesis_stream property. The producer uses the KPL (Kinesis Producer Library) and uses the KPL built in configurations. Copy kinesis-producer-library.properties.example to kinesis-producer-library.properties and configure the properties file to your needs. You are required to configure the region. For example: # set explicitly Region=us-west-2 # or set with an environment variable Region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION By default, the KPL implements record aggregation , which usually increases producer throughput by allowing you to increase the number of records sent per API call. However, aggregated records are encoded differently (using Google Protocol Buffers) than records that are not aggregated. Therefore, if you are not using the KCL (Kinesis Client Library) to consume records (for example, you are using AWS Lambda) you will need to either disaggregate the records in your consumer (for example, by using the AWS Kinesis Aggregation library ), or disable record aggregation in your kinesis-producer-library.properties configuration. To disable aggregation, add the following to your configuration: AggregationEnabled=false Remember: if you disable record aggregation, you will lose the benefit of potentially greater producer throughput. SQS AWS Credentials You will need to obtain an IAM user that has the permission to access the SQS service. The SQS producer also uses DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain to get AWS credentials. See the AWS docs on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain. In case you need to set up a different region also along with credentials then default one, see the AWS docs . Options Set the output queue in the config.properties by setting the following properites sqs_signing_region : the region to use for SigV4 signing of requests. e.g. us-east-1 sqs_service_endpoint : the service endpoint either with or without the protocol (e.g. https://sns.us-west-1.amazonaws.com or sns.us-west-1.amazonaws.com ) sqs_queue_uri : the full SQS queue uri from AWS console. e.g. https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xxxxxxxxxxxx/maxwell The producer uses the AWS SQS SDK . SNS AWS Credentials You will need to obtain an IAM user that has the permission to access the SNS topic. The SNS producer also uses DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain to get AWS credentials. See the AWS docs on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain. In case you need to set up a different region also along with credentials then default one, see the AWS docs . Options Set the topic arn in the config.properties by setting the sns_topic property to the topic name. FIFO topics should have a .fifo suffix. Optionally, you can enable sns_attrs to have maxwell attach various attributes to the message for subscription filtering. (Only database and table are currently supported) The producer uses the AWS SNS SDK . Nats The configurable properties for nats are: nats_url - defaults to nats://localhost:4222 nats_subject - defaults to %{database}.%{table} nats_subject defines the Nats subject hierarchy to write to. Topic substitution is available. All non-alphanumeric characters in the substitued values will be replaced by underscores. Google Cloud Pub/Sub In order to publish to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you will need to obtain an IAM service account that has been granted the roles/pubsub.publisher role. See the Google Cloud Platform docs for the latest examples of which permissions are needed , as well as how to properly configure service accounts . Set the output stream in config.properties by setting the pubsub_project_id and pubsub_topic properties. Optionally configure a dedicated output topic for DDL updates by setting the ddl_pubsub_topic property. The producer uses the Google Cloud Java Library for Pub/Sub and uses its built-in configurations. Google Cloud BigQuery To stream data into Google Cloud Bigquery, first there must be a table created on bigquery in order to stream the data into defined as bigquery_project_id.bigquery_dataset.bigquery_table . The schema of the table must match the outputConfig. The column types should be defined as below database: string table: string type: string ts: integer xid: integer xoffset: integer commit: boolean position: string gtid: string server_id: integer primary_key: string data: string old: string See the Google Cloud Platform docs for the latest examples of which permissions are needed , as well as how to properly configure service accounts . Set the output stream in config.properties by setting the bigquery_project_id , bigquery_dataset and bigquery_table properties. The producer uses the Google Cloud Java Bigquery Storage Library for Bigquery Bigquery Storage Write API documenatation . To use the Storage Write API, you must have bigquery.tables.updateData permissions. This producer is using the Default Stream with at-least once semantics for greater data resiliency and fewer scaling restrictions RabbitMQ To produce messages to RabbitMQ, you will need to specify a host in config.properties with rabbitmq_host . This is the only required property, everything else falls back to a sane default. The remaining configurable properties are: rabbitmq_user - defaults to guest rabbitmq_pass - defaults to guest rabbitmq_virtual_host - defaults to / rabbitmq_handshake_timeout - defaults to 10000 rabbitmq_exchange - defaults to maxwell rabbitmq_exchange_type - defaults to fanout rabbitmq_exchange_durable - defaults to false rabbitmq_exchange_autodelete - defaults to false rabbitmq_routing_key_template - defaults to %db%.%table% This config controls the routing key, where %db% and %table% are placeholders that will be substituted at runtime rabbitmq_message_persistent - defaults to false rabbitmq_declare_exchange - defaults to true rabbitmq_use_ssl - defaults to false For more details on these options, you are encouraged to the read official RabbitMQ documentation here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html Redis Choose type of redis data structure to create to by setting redis_type to one of: pubsub , xadd , lpush or rpush . The default is pubsub . redis_key defaults to \"maxwell\" and supports topic substitution Other configurable properties are: redis_host - defaults to localhost redis_port - defaults to 6379 redis_auth - defaults to null redis_database - defaults to 0 redis_type - defaults to pubsub redis_key - defaults to maxwell redis_stream_json_key - defaults to message redis_sentinels - doesn't have a default value redis_sentinel_master_name - doesn't have a default value Custom Producer If none of the producers packaged with Maxwell meet your requirements, a custom producer can be added at runtime. In order to register your custom producer, you must implement the ProducerFactory interface, which is responsible for creating your custom AbstractProducer . Next, set the custom_producer.factory configuration property to your ProducerFactory 's fully qualified class name. Then add the custom ProducerFactory JAR and all its dependencies to the $MAXWELL_HOME/lib directory. Your custom producer will likely require configuration properties as well. For that, use the custom_producer.* (or CUSTOM_PRODUCER_* if using env-variable configuration) property namespace. Those properties will be available to your producer via MaxwellConfig.customProducerProperties . Custom producer factory and producer examples can be found here: https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/tree/master/src/example/com/zendesk/maxwell/example/producerfactory Topic substitution Some producers may be given a template string from which they dynamically generate a topic (or whatever their equivalent of a kafka topic is).
