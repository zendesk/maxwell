--replay                                      | enable maxwell's read-only "replay" mode.  Not available in config.properties.

### Properties file
***
If maxwell finds the file `config.properties` in $PWD it will use it.  Any
command line options (except init_position and replay) may be given as
"key=value" pairs.

Additionally, any configuration file options prefixed with 'kafka.' will be
passed into the kafka producer library, after having 'kafka.' stripped off the
front of the key.  So, for example if config.properties contains

```
kafka.batch.size=16384
```

then Maxwell will send `batch.size=16384` to the kafka producer library.

### Running against RDS
***
To run Maxwell against RDS, (either Aurora or Mysql) you will need to do the following:

- set binlog_format to "ROW".  Do this in the "parameter groups" section.  For a Mysql-RDS instance this parameter will be
  in a "DB Parameter Group", for Aurora it will be in a "DB Cluster Parameter Group".
- setup RDS binlog retention as described [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.html).
  The tl;dr is to execute `call mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 24)` on the server.


### Filters
***
The options `include_dbs`, `exclude_dbs`, `include_tables`, and `exclude_tables` control whether
Maxwell will send an update for a given row to its producer.  All the options take a single value PATTERN,
which may either be a literal table/database name, given as `option=name`, or a regular expression,
given as `option=/regex/`.  The options are evaluated as follows:

1. only accept databases in `include_dbs` if non-empty
1. reject databases in `exclude_dbs`
1. only accept tables in `include_tables` if non-empty
1. reject tables in `exclude_tables`

So an example like `--include_dbs=/foo.*/ --exclude_tables=bar` will include `footy.zab` and exclude `footy.bar`

The option `blacklist_tables` and `blacklist_dbs` controls whether Maxwell will send updates for a table to its producer AND whether
it captures schema changes for that table or database. Note that once Maxwell has been running with a table or database marked as blacklisted,
you *must* continue to run Maxwell with that table or database blacklisted or else Maxwell will halt. If you want to stop
blacklisting a table or database, you will have to drop the maxwell schema first.

### Schema storage host vs replica host
***
Maxwell needs two sets of mysql permissions to operate properly: a mysql database in which to store schema snapshots,
and a mysql host to replicate from.  The recommended configuration is that
these two functions are provided by a single mysql host.  In this case, just
specify `host`, `user`, etc.

Some configurations, however, may need to write data to a different server than it replicates from.  In this case,
the host described by `host`, `user`, ..., will be used to write schema information to, and Maxwell will replicate
events from the host described by `replication_host`, `replication_user`, ...  Note that bootstrapping is not available
in this configuration.

### running multiple instances of maxwell against the same master
***
Maxwell can operate with multiple instances running against a single master, in
different configurations.  This can be useful if you wish to have producers
running in different configurations, for example producing different groups of
tables to different topics.  Each instance of Maxwell must be configured with a
unique `client_id`, in order to store unique binlog positions.

#### multiple instances on a 5.5 server

With MySQL 5.5 and below, each replicator (be it mysql, maxwell, whatever) must
also be configured with a unique `replica_server_id`.  This is a 32-bit integer
that corresponds to mysql's `server_id` parameter.  The value you configure
should be unique across all mysql and maxwell instances.
