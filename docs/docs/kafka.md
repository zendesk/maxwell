### Kafka options

Any options given to Maxwell that are prefixed with `kafka.` will be passed directly into the Kafka producer configuration
(with `kafka.` stripped off).  We use the "new producer" configuration, as described here:
[http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs)

Maxwell sets the following Kafka options by default, but you can override them in `config.properties`.

- kafka.acks = 1
- kafka.compression.type = gzip

Maxwell writes to a kafka topic named "maxwell" by default.  This can be changed with the `kafka_topic` option.

### Kafka key

Maxwell generates keys for its Kafka messages based upon a mysql row's primary key:

```
db:test_db/tbl:test_tbl/id:93/id_2:17910090
```

This key is designed to co-operate with Kafka's log compaction, which will save the last-known
value for a key, allowing Maxwell's Kafka stream to retain the last-known value for a row and act
as a source of truth.

### Topic and partitioning

Maxwell enforces ordering on events within a logical mysql database (but not within a mysql server).  We enforce
this ordering by choosing a kafka partition based on an event's database name (`dbName.hashCode() % numPartitions`).
This means that you should create a kafka topic for Maxwell with at least as many partitions as you have logical databases:

```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper ZK_HOST:2181 --create \
                    --topic maxwell --partitions 20 --replication-factor 2
```
