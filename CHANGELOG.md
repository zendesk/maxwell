### [v1.15.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.15.0): 

This is a bug-fix release, but it's big enough I'm giving it a minor
version.

- Fix a very old bug in which DDL rows were writing the *start* of the
row into `maxwell.positions`, leading to chaos in some scenarios where
maxwell managed to stop on the row and double-process it, as well as to
a few well-meaning patches.
- Fix the fact that maxwell was outputting "next-position" instead of
"position" of a row into JSON.
- Fix the master-recovery code to store schema that corresponds to the
start of a row, and points the replicator at the next-position.

Much thanks to Tim, Likun and others in sorting this mess out.

_2017-07-25_

### [v1.10.4](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.4): 

Notable changes:

 - Shutdown hardening. If maxwell can't shut down (because the kafka
   producer is in a bad state and `close()` never terminates, for example),
   it would previously stall and process no messages. Now, shutdown is run
   in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which
   forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10
   seconds.
 - Initial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own
   process. This mode of operation is still experimental, but we'll
   accept PRs to improve it (thanks Geoff Lywood).
 - Fix incorrect handling of negative (pre-epoch dates) when using
   binlog_connector mode (thanks Geoff Lywood).



_2017-07-10_

### [v1.10.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.2): 

- added metrics: "replication.queue.time" and "inflightmessages.count"
- renamed "time.overall" metric to "message.publish.time"
- documentation updates (thanks Chintan Tank)



_2017-06-04_

### [v1.10.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.1): 

The observable changes in this minor release are a new configuration for Kafka/Kinesis producer to abort processing on publish errors, and support of Kafka 0.10.2. Also a bunch of good refactoring has been done for heartbeat processing. List of changes:   

- Support Kafka 0.10.2   
- Stop procesing RDS hearbeats   
- Keep maxwell heartbeat going every 10 seconds when database is quiet   
- Allow for empty double-quoted string literals for database schema changes   
- Ignore Kafka/Kinesis producer errors based on new configuration ignore_producer_error

_2017-05-26_

### [v1.10.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.0): 

This is a small release, primarily around a change to how schemas are
stored. Maxwell now stores the `last_heartbeat_read` with each entry
in the `schemas` table, making schema management more resilient to
cases where binlog numbers are reused, but means that you must take
care if you need to roll back to an earlier version. If you deploy
v1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually
update all `schemas`.`last_heartbeat_read` values to `0` before
redeploying v1.10.0 or higher.

Other minor changes:

  - allow negative default numbers in columns
  - only store final binlog position if it has changed
  - blacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*'
  - log4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging)



_2017-05-09_

### [v1.9.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.9.0): 

Maxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by
Scott Ferguson. Multiple backends can be configured, read the updated
docs for full details.

There's also some bugfixes:

- filter DDL messages based on config
- determine newest schema from binlog order, not creation order
- add task manager to shutdown cleanly on error
- minor logging improvements



_2017-04-26_

### [v1.8.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.2): 

Bugfix release.

- maxwell would crash on a quoted partition name

- use seconds instead of milliseconds for DDL messages



_2017-04-11_

### [v1.8.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.1): 

- performance improves in capturing and restoring schema, thx Joren
  Minnaert
- Allow for capturing from a separate mysql host (adds support for using
  Maxscale as a replication proxy), thx Adam Szkoda


_2017-02-20_

### [v1.8.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.0):

  binlog event, leading to crashes or in some cases data mismatches.


_2017-01-30_

### [v1.7.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.7.1): 

- bootstrapping now can take a `--where` clause

_2017-01-24_

### [v1.7.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.7.0): 

Maxwell 1.7 brings 2 major new, alpha features.  The first is Mysql 5.7
support, including JSON column type support and handling of 5.7 SQL, but
_not_ including GTID support yet.  This is based on porting Maxwell to
Stanley Shyko's binlog-connector library.  Thanks to Stanley for his
amazing support doing this port.

The second major new feature is a producer for Amazon's Kinesis streams,
This was contributed in full by the dogged and persistent Thomas Dziedzic.
Check it out with `--producer=kinesis`.

There's also some bugfixes:
- Amazon RDS heartbeat events now tick maxwell's position, thx Scott Ferguson
- allow CHECK() statements inside column definitions


_2017-01-07_

### [v1.6.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.6.0): 

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it gets a minor version bump due to
a single change of behavior: dates and timestamps which mysql may
accept, but are considered invalid (0000-00-00 is a notable example)
previously had inconsistent behavior.  Now we convert these to NULL.
Other bugfixes:
- heartbeats have moved into their own table
- more fixes around alibaba rds
- ignore DELETE statements that are output for MEMORY tables upon server
  restart
- allow pointing maxwell to a pre-existing database

- Maxwell will now include by default fields with NULL values (as null
  fields).  To disable this and restore the old functionality where fields
  were omitted, pass `--output_nulls=false`

1.2.0 is a major release of Maxwell that introduces master recovery
features; when a slave is promoted to master, Maxwell is now capable of
recovering the position.  See the `--master_recovery` flag for more
details.

It also upgrades the kafka producer library to 0.9.  If you're using
maxwell with a kafka 0.8 server, you must now pass the `--kafka0.8` flag
to maxwell.


_2016-09-12_

### [v1.1.6](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.1.6):

_2015-11-23_

### [v0.14.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.2):

### [v0.14.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.1): 

- fixes a parser bug around named PRIMARY KEYs.


_2015-11-17_

### [v0.14.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.0):

Lucky release number 13 brings some reasonably big changes:

- detect and fail early if we see `binlog_row_image=minimal`
- kill off maxwell if the position thread dies
- fix a bug where maxwell could pick up a copy of schema from a different server_id (curse you operator precedence!)


_2015-09-18_

### [v0.11.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.1): 

- maxwell gets a very minimal pass at detecting when a master has changed, in which it will kill off schemas and positions from a server_id that no longer is valid.  this should prevent the worst of cases.


_2015-09-16_

### [v0.11.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.0): 

This release of Maxwell preserves transaction information in the kafka stream by adding a `xid` key in the JSON object, as well as a `commit` key for the final row inside the transaction.
