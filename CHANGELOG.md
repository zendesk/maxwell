     - fix the encryption issue (https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/issues/803)


### [v1.10.9](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.9): "no one left behind"

We recommend all v1.10.7 and v1.10.8 users upgrade to v1.10.9.

 - Add missing Kafka clients
 - Listen and report on binlog connector lifecycle events for better visibility
 - Reduce docker image size

 - Fix docker builds
 - Add Google Cloud Pub/Sub producer
 - RabbitMQ producer enhancements


### [v1.10.7](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.7): "it's never too l8!"

- Java 8 upgrade
- Diagnostic health check endpoint
- Encryption
- Documentation update: encryption, kinesis producer, schema storage fundamentals, etc.

### [v1.10.6](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.6): "a new starter is here"


 - Binlog-connector upgrade
 - Bug-fix: when using literal string for an option that accepts Regex, Regex characters are no longer special
 - If master recovery is enabled, Maxwell cleans up old positions for the same server and client id


### [v1.10.5](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.5): "half asleep on her couch"


- Shyko's binlog-connector is now the default and only replication
backend available for maxwell.


### [v1.10.4](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.4): "shutdown --harder"


Notable changes:

 - Shutdown hardening. If maxwell can't shut down (because the kafka
   producer is in a bad state and `close()` never terminates, for example),
   it would previously stall and process no messages. Now, shutdown is run
   in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which
   forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10
   seconds.
 - Initial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own
   process. This mode of operation is still experimental, but we'll
   accept PRs to improve it (thanks Geoff Lywood).
 - Fix incorrect handling of negative (pre-epoch dates) when using
   binlog_connector mode (thanks Geoff Lywood).


### [v1.10.3](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.3): "1.10.2-and-a-bit"


 - tiny release to fix a units error in the `replication.lag` metric
   (subtracting seconds from milliseconds)


### [v1.10.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.2): "just in time for tomorrow"


- added metrics: "replication.queue.time" and "inflightmessages.count"
- renamed "time.overall" metric to "message.publish.time"
- documentation updates (thanks Chintan Tank)


### [v1.10.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.1): "forgive and forget"

The observable changes in this minor release are a new configuration for Kafka/Kinesis producer to abort processing on publish errors, and support of Kafka 0.10.2. Also a bunch of good refactoring has been done for heartbeat processing. List of changes:   

- Support Kafka 0.10.2   
- Stop procesing RDS hearbeats   
- Keep maxwell heartbeat going every 10 seconds when database is quiet   
- Allow for empty double-quoted string literals for database schema changes   
- Ignore Kafka/Kinesis producer errors based on new configuration ignore_producer_error

### [v1.10.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.10.0): "slightly more ones than zeroes"

This is a small release, primarily around a change to how schemas are
stored. Maxwell now stores the `last_heartbeat_read` with each entry
in the `schemas` table, making schema management more resilient to
cases where binlog numbers are reused, but means that you must take
care if you need to roll back to an earlier version. If you deploy
v1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually
update all `schemas`.`last_heartbeat_read` values to `0` before
redeploying v1.10.0 or higher.

Other minor changes:

  - allow negative default numbers in columns
  - only store final binlog position if it has changed
  - blacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*'
  - log4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging)


### [v1.9.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.9.0): "now with added whimsy"

Maxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by
Scott Ferguson. Multiple backends can be configured, read the updated
docs for full details.

There's also some bugfixes:

- filter DDL messages based on config
- determine newest schema from binlog order, not creation order
- add task manager to shutdown cleanly on error
- minor logging improvements


### [v1.8.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.2): "just as the postcards wept"


Bugfix release.

- maxwell would crash on a quoted partition name
- fixes for alters on non-string tables containing VARCHAR
- use seconds instead of milliseconds for DDL messages


### [v1.8.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.1): "famous is faster, don't have to be talented"


- performance improves in capturing and restoring schema, thx Joren
  Minnaert
- Allow for capturing from a separate mysql host (adds support for using
  Maxscale as a replication proxy), thx Adam Szkoda

### [v1.8.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.8.0): "upbeat, honest, contradictory"


In version 1.8.0 Maxwell gains alpha support for GTID-based positions!
All praise due to Henry Cai.

### [v1.7.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.7.2): "comparing self to better"


- Fix a bug found where maxwell could cache the wrong TABLE_MAP_ID for a
  binlog event, leading to crashes or in some cases data mismatches.

### [v1.7.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.7.1): "blame it on your seratonin"


- bootstrapping now can take a `--where` clause
- performance improvements in the kafka producer

### [v1.7.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.7.0): "lucky me, lucky mud"


Maxwell 1.7 brings 2 major new, alpha features.  The first is Mysql 5.7
support, including JSON column type support and handling of 5.7 SQL, but
_not_ including GTID support yet.  This is based on porting Maxwell to
Stanley Shyko's binlog-connector library.  Thanks to Stanley for his
amazing support doing this port.

The second major new feature is a producer for Amazon's Kinesis streams,
This was contributed in full by the dogged and persistent Thomas Dziedzic.
Check it out with `--producer=kinesis`.

There's also some bugfixes:
- Amazon RDS heartbeat events now tick maxwell's position, thx Scott Ferguson
- allow CHECK() statements inside column definitions

### [v1.6.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.6.0): "give me a quest"

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it gets a minor version bump due to
a single change of behavior: dates and timestamps which mysql may
accept, but are considered invalid (0000-00-00 is a notable example)
previously had inconsistent behavior.  Now we convert these to NULL.
Other bugfixes:
- heartbeats have moved into their own table
- more fixes around alibaba rds
- ignore DELETE statements that are output for MEMORY tables upon server
  restart
- allow pointing maxwell to a pre-existing database

### [v1.5.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.5.0): "someone, somewhere, is still smoking cigarettes, damnit"


- CHANGE: Kafka producer no longer ships with hard-coded defaults.
  Please ensure you have "compression.type", "metadata.fetch.timeout.ms", and "retries"
  configured to your liking.

  fields).  To disable this and restore the old functionality where fields
  were omitted, pass `--output_nulls=false`
- Fix an issue with multi-client support where two replicators would
  ping-pong heartbeats at each other
- Fix an issue where a client would attempt to recover a position from a
  mismatched client_id
- Fix a bug when using CHANGE COLUMN on a primary key

1.2.0 is a major release of Maxwell that introduces master recovery
features; when a slave is promoted to master, Maxwell is now capable of
recovering the position.  See the `--master_recovery` flag for more
details.

It also upgrades the kafka producer library to 0.9.  If you're using
maxwell with a kafka 0.8 server, you must now pass the `--kafka0.8` flag
to maxwell.

### [v1.1.6](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.1.6): "pithy"


- minor bugfix in which maxwell with --replay mode was trying to write
  heartbeats

### [v1.1.5](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.1.5): "my brain is a polluted mess"

  the positions table that we can co-ordinate around.

### [v1.1.4](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v1.1.4): "george flunk"


- add support for a bunch more charsets (gbk, big5, notably)
- fix Maxwell's handling of kafka errors - previously we were trying to
  crash Maxwell by throwing a RuntimeException out of the Kafka
  Producer, but this was a failure.  Now we log and skip all errors.

- handle BOOLEAN columns with true/false defaults

### [v0.14.4](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.4): "You'd think we'd be at 1.0 by now, wouldn't you?"

- fixes parsing of "mysql comments" (`/*! .. */`)
- More performance improvements, another 10% in a tight loop.

### [v0.14.3](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.3): "Peanuts.  My girlfriend thinks about peanuts."

- fixes a regression in 0.14.2 that creates duplicate copies of the "mysql" database in the schema.

### [v0.14.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.14.2): "Maxwell Sandvik 88"

- capture the mysql database along with the rest of the schema.  Eliding it was a bad premature optimization that led to crashes when tables in the mysql database changed.

### [v0.13.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.13.1): "well that was somewhat expected"

v0.13.1 is a bug fix of v0.13.0 -- fixes a bug where long rows were truncated. 

v0.13.0 contains:
- Big performance boost for maxwell: 75% faster in some benchmarks
- @davidsheldon contributed some nice bug fixes around `CREATE TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`, which were previously generating new, bogus copies of the schema.

### [v0.13.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.13.0): "Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Sheldon?"

Lucky release number 13 brings some reasonably big changes:
- Big performance boost for maxwell: 75% faster in some benchmarks
- @davidsheldon contributed some nice bug fixes around `CREATE TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`, which were previously generating new, bogus copies of the schema.
- we now include a "scavenger thread" that will lazily clean out old, deleted schemas.

_This release has a pretty bad bug.  do not use._

### [v0.12.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.12.0): "what do I call them?  Slippers?  Why, are you jealous?"

- add support for BIT columns.  

### [v0.11.4](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.4): "13 steps"

this is another bugfix release that fixes a problem where the replication thread can die in the middle of processing a transaction event.  I really need to fix this at a lower level, ie the open-replicator level.

### [v0.11.3](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.3): ".. and the other half is to take the bugs out"

this is a bugfix release:
- fix problems with table creation options inside alter statements ( `ALTER TABLE foo auto_increment=10` )
- fix a host of shutdown-procedure bugs

the test suite should also be way more reliable, not like you care.

### [v0.11.2](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.2): "savage acts of unprovoked violence are bad"

This is a bugfix release.  It includes:
- soft deletions of maxwell.schemas to fix A->B->A master swapping without creating intense replication delay
- detect and fail early if we see `binlog_row_image=minimal`
- kill off maxwell if the position thread dies
- fix a bug where maxwell could pick up a copy of schema from a different server_id (curse you operator precedence!)

### [v0.11.1](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.1): "dog snoring loudly"

- maxwell gets a very minimal pass at detecting when a master has changed, in which it will kill off schemas and positions from a server_id that no longer is valid.  this should prevent the worst of cases.

### [v0.11.0](https://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/releases/tag/v0.11.0): "cat waving gently"

It also contains a bugfix around server_id handling.
